[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
## Description
This is a text editor application designed to be used online or offline using indexDB to store the user data.  The key piece of the application is Webpack (https://webpack.js.org) which really does all the work to prepare the app for deployment, handling the configuration the developer creates.
## Usage and Installation
By visiting this application on Heroku, you can download this application and it will be ready to use. If you want to take this code and modify it for your own application, clone the repository.  The most important code is the src file for the actual application.  Be sure to be running node and express.  Open the root file package.json to see the custom scripts and how they work with the custom scripts in the client and server directories to know which npm commands to use in your integrated terminal.
Also, review all the depenedencies so you are aware of the packages you will be installing when you "npm install".

## Resources and Contributors
Watching class videos on the PWA (Progressive Web Application) was the most help. And the Webpack documetation was key to understanding the code for the configuration: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/.  This website https://web.dev/indexeddb/ was also very helpful in understanding how the indexDB works, especially the concept of the "transaction" (tx).
